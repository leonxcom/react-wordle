# React-dle

A word guessing game built with React, inspired by Wordle. This is a fun project focused on delivering a smooth user experience with clean code.

## About

React-dle is a daily word game where players have 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter word. After each guess, the game provides color-coded feedback:
- ðŸŸ© Green: Correct letter in the right position
- ðŸŸ¨ Yellow: Correct letter in the wrong position
- â¬› Gray: Letter not in the word

This project was originally converted from [Vue Wordle](https://github.com/yyx990803/vue-wordle) with several added features and optimizations:
- Light/dark theme support with system preference detection
- Game state persistence in localStorage
- Complete statistics tracking
- Game result sharing
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-dle.git
   cd react-dle
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run development server
   ```
   pnpm run dev
   ```

4. Build for production
   ```
   pnpm run build
   ```

## Custom Words

You can create your own word puzzle and share it with friends by base64-encoding a word and including it as the URL query parameter:
```
https://your-deployed-site.com/?YmxpbXA=
```

This method also allows using words that aren't in the default dictionary.

## Project Structure

The project uses a feature-based organization rather than organizing by technical type:
